## Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone--Case-Study 1 & 2

These are case studies of MOOC Google Data Analytics Capstone Complete a Case Study, part of Google Data Analytics Certificate.

Based on prior experience with MySQL and Teradata, as gained from another online course, Managing Big Data with MySQL, which by the way I personally feel is the best SQL course for beginners that I have taken, with considerable practice to advance query skills. 

However, after online reseach on the accessbility of multiple SQL tools, I used SQLite to create database and start querying. This SQL platform is free but its date related syntax are different from other common SQL dialacts. Thus I switched to PostgreSQL to continue the 2 case studies. 

SQL courses I completed are offered by 4 different institutions:
1. <strong> Managing Big Data with MySQL, by Duke University <strong> 

   MySQL and Teradata are the platforms used.  
2. <strong> Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL, by University of California, Davis<strong> 

   Data is hosted on mode, which is very similar to the flavor of PostgreSQL.
   
   <strong> Distributed Computing with Spark SQL, University of California, Davis <strong> 
   
   This course is offered by Databricks, an introduction to the Spark platform. 
   
3. <strong> Tools for Exploratory Data Analysis in Business, by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<strong> 

   SQL is one part of the tools taught, which include Power BI and Alteryx.
4. <strong> Google Data Analytics Certificate, by Google<strong> 
 
   SQL is taught using BigQuery in 3 out of the total 8 courses (course 3-5), not in a very systematic way as it is in conjunction with spreadsheet.
